								<h3>How it started</h3>
								<p>When I was very young, every time I was asked "What do you want to be when you grow up?" I always had a different answer. At first I wanted to be a doctor, a singer, an astronaut, a librarian, a painter... When I grew up I said I wanted to be a psychologist, a teacher, a field journalist, a photographer and so on. Each job had some relevance to me, but I didn't know exactly what I needed to do to get there. Or if the choices were really right for me.</p>

								<his> Even as an adult, sometimes it's hard. You may have some ideas about what you want to do, but even so, there are a lot of causes that can influence the choices you can make. This app can't tell you what you need to do next, but it will help in providing with all the necessary information and guide you to the most suitable path.</p>
